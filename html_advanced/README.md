# 🌐 HTML Introduction

Welcome to the **HTML Intro** repository! This project is for beginners who want to learn the basics of **HTML**, the backbone of every website.  

## 📖 What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create webpages. It structures the content you see on the web, such as:

- Text  
- Images  
- Links  
- Lists  
- Tables  
- Forms  

HTML works together with **CSS** (for styling) and **JavaScript** (for interactivity).
