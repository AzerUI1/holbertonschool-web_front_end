# 🎨 CSS Introduction

Welcome to the **CSS Intro** repository! This project is for beginners who want to learn the basics of **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets), which makes websites look beautiful and visually appealing.  

## 📖 What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and format the appearance of HTML elements. With CSS, you can:

- Change colors, fonts, and text size  
- Add spacing and layouts  
- Create responsive designs for all devices  
- Add animations and transitions  
- Style forms, buttons, and images  

CSS works together with **HTML** (structure) and **JavaScript** (interactivity).
